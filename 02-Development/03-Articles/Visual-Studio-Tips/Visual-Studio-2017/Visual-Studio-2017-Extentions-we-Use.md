Here is a list of Visual Studio Extentions we use and recommend
## Essentials
### Class Outline
A tool that shows you a window with all the classes and inner classes in a file.

When you right click on any file, you'll see the different important methods of it, such as OnStart etc... and will also be able to go directly to the controller's view
