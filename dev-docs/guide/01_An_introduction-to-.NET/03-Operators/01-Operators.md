# Operators


An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations

**+=**  
used to accumulation 
int i=5;

If we want to add 6 to i we can write:  
i = i+6;  
Or  
i+=6;

**-=**  
The same goes for minus  
if we want to reduce 2 from i we can write:  
i-=2;  


***=**   
We will use the *= to multiple the number  
i\*=3

**/=**  
and this operator to divide the number  
i/=3;

**++**  
The ++ operator is used to increase the value by 1  
int i=5;  
i++;  
at this point i will be 6.

**--**  
The - operator reduces the value by 1  
int i=5;  
i--;  
at this point i will be 4.
