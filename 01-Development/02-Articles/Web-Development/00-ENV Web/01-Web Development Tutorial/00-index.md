In this tutorial we'll create a complex order & order detail form, and cover the day to day development tasks all the way from creating the server side API to developing the front end with Typescript and Angular.

We'll show you how with relatively little effort you can develop a great web/mobile front end for your application, and cover the following development tasks (among others)
1. Displaying data, including a master detail display
2. User filtering, and sorting of millions of rows
2. Updating and validating data
3. Data lookups and select lists
4. Web and Mobile execution


Let's get started.
