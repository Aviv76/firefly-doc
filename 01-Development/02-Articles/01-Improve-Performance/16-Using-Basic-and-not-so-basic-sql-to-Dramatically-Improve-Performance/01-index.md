In this set of videos we'll take a real case from one of our customers where we were able to improve a process that takes 5 minutes, into one second using the powers of SQL.

We use the internal visual studio sql editor - as explained in:
[Writing sqls from within Visual Studio](writing-sqls-from-within-visual-studio.html)

We'll start with an intro where we explain the controller's functionality which is the target of our performance improvement.
We'll then explain basic SQL and move through the steps, through not so basic SQL, until we reach the target of our improvement.
