Visual Studio is the best IDE for .NET development. Usually, when starting with .NET most developers choose the free community edition, which is much similar to the Professional edition.  
You can compare Visual Studio editions here: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/compare/  
However, the community edition has some limitations in features as well as in its license-terms. For more info refer to  https://www.visualstudio.com/license-terms/mlt553321/

For more advanced features, we recommend to become a Microsoft partner. Microsoft has a plan for companies of all sizes. We use this plan and get 5 full MSDN accounts which allows us to download any Microsoft product fully licensed. There are other benefits for partners, such as Azure credit etc.
The price for this partnership is very cheap for what you get. Currently it's few hundreds of dollars a year. Most of our clients are choosing the same path.
