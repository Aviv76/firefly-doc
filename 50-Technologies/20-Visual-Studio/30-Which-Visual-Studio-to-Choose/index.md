## Standalone license ##
Visual Studio is the best IDE for .NET development. Usually, when starting developing in .NET, most developers choose the free **Community** edition. This edition is very much similar to the **Professional** edition and is sufficient for maintaining the migrated application.  
However, the **Community** edition has some limitations in features as well as in its license-terms. It is more suitable for small organization of up to 5 developers. You can read the full license terms here. https://www.visualstudio.com/license-terms/mlt553321/

For small development teams that want a little extra features, it is recommended to purchase a standalone license for the **Professional** edition. At the time of writing this it is priced at 499$.

## Becoming Microsoft Partner ##
If you are a software house, we recommend to become a Microsoft partner. Microsoft has a plan for companies of all sizes. We use this plan and get 5 full MSDN accounts which allows us to download any Microsoft product, including the expensive Visual Studio **Enterprise** edition fully licensed. There are other benefits for partners, such as training and support.
The price for this partnership is very cheap for what you get. Currently, it's a few hundreds of dollars a year.
