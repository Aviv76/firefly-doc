This Visual Studio extension allows quick navigation based on a call stack you receive from an error report by your customer.
It automatically turns it into a set of hyper links that help you navigate the code.

You can download it from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SamirBoulema.StackTraceExplorer)
