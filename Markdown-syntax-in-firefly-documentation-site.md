# Markdown syntax in Firefly documentation site

The documents in our documentation site are written with Markdown language.
Here are some guide lines to markdown language to write a document to be displayed in our site:

**File name**  
The file name cannot contains spaces, instead use the hyphen sign to separate between the words.  
for example: Column-Collection-and-Recompute.md  
 
**Document Title**  
Do not specify a title to the file as by default the title is taken from the file name. The hyphen are replaced with spaces. 

**Internal titles**    
To display titles inside the document use '###' before the text.
```
### My Internal Title
```
### My Internal Title

**New line**  
To force new line add 2 spaces at the end of the line. 

**Keywords**  
Keywords are used to make the document searchable also based on text that doesn’t appear in the document itself.
Keywords are added at the top of the document using this syntax:
keywords: text1, text2, text2

**Bold text**  
Add 2  asterisks before the text and after.

**Italic**  
Write the text between single asterisks.

**Inline code**  
Inline code is srounded with back-ticks.  
start with  \`\`\`  csdiff    
ends  with  \`\`\` 

**new code line** – will be displayed with green background if you use the + (plus) sign at the before the text   
**removed code line** - will be displayed with red background if you use the – (minus) sign before the text.

**Youtube video Link**   
Use the Embed option in youtube share button, copy the link and paste it in the document.

**Image**  
Make sure to upload the image and use the bellow syntax: !\[Name to be displayed](ImageName)
