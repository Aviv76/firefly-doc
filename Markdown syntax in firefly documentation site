# Markdown syntax in Firefly documentation site

The documents in our documentation site are written with Markdown language.

Here are a few tips of how to write a document to be displayed in our site:

1.	File name
The file name cannot contains spaces, 
instead we are using the hyphen sign to separate between the words
for example: Column-Collection-and-Recompute
 
2.	Document Title
By default the document title is taken from the file name. The hyphen are replaced with spaces, so you do not need to define a title.
If you would like to have a title different than the file name use the # sign before the text
For example: # 

3.	Internal titles:
To display titles inside the document use '###' before the title
### What is .Net

4.	Keywords
Keywords are used to make the document searchable also based on text that doesn’t appear in the document itself.
Keywords are added at the top of the document using this syntax:
keywords: text1, text2, text2


5.	Emphasis
a.	Bold text will be written between 2 strikes.
    Make sure you don’t have space between the strikes and the text.
b.	Italic – text written between a single strikes *aaaa*


6.	Code
To mark text as code start the code section with  ```csdiff 
and ends the section with  ``` .
To mark a new code line – that will be displayed with green background use the + sign at the before the text 
To mark a line of code that has been removed use the – sign before the text.
This line will be displayed with red background

7.	To insert Link from youtube use the Embed option and copy the link.

8.	To insert Image
Make sure to upload the image and use the bellow syntax:
![Name](ImageName)

9.	Link
