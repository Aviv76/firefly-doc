FlowUIController is a controller where the tab order is managed by the Columns collection and not by the controls on the form.

It also allows you to inject logic that will be executed when you move between these controls.

In non FlowUIController controllers the tab order is controlled by the tab order see [TabOrder article](TabOrder.html)
